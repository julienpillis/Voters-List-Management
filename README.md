# Voters-List-Management

Whithin the scope of the NF16 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course @ UTC, I had to manage lists of voters using linked lists in C. 

Structure of the project:
  - main.c : Here, you'll find the menu of features that the project offers.
  - tp3.c : All features are implemented in this file, as functions.
  - tp3.h : The header file of tp3.c
  - liste.txt : This file is an example of a list of voters readable by the file reader function.
  - Rapport_Projet_Complexite.pdf : Project report with function complexity study
  
  
[remarks] : 
  - all in-file comments and report are in french.  
  - The grade given by teachers for this work : 18/20

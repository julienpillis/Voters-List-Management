# Voters-List-Management

Whithin the scope of the NF16 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course @ Université de Technologie de Compiègne, I had to manage lists of voters using linked lists in C. 

The goal of this project/practical work is to create a program that manages data relating to voters (name, CIN number and choice) of the presidential election. For the data processing of voters (different choices within the menu), we will have to use the implementation of lists of voters as linked lists in C language. To use this data structure, we will need to define the cells of the list, representing the voters and their attributes, as well as the list itself, a pointer to the first cell (the head).

Structure of the project:
  - main.c : Here, you'll find the menu of features that the project offers.
  - tp3.c : All features are implemented in this file, as functions.
  - tp3.h : The header file of tp3.c
  - liste.txt : This file is an example of a list of voters readable by the file reader function.
  - Rapport_Projet_Complexite.pdf : Project report about how it works and function complexity study.
  
  
[remarks] : 
  - all in-file comments and report are in french.  
  - The grade given by teachers for this work : 18/20
